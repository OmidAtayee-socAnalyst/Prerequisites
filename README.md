# Prerequisites:
For this project, we need to have the following prerequisites accomplished:
1. A VirtualBox setup with Kali & Windows VMs installed
2. VMs configured so they can talk to each other
3. Splunk & Sysmon installed on the target machine (We want to make sure to look at the telemetry)

Network Configuration for Win10
_It is just the same as configuring Kali!_
